This software comprise of three parts( Core  functionality )
# THE FIRST
The first core functionality is book locator as I call it. It is a search system that locates a book in any part of the library.
Libraries are always divided into sections for easy management. These sections interms have shelfs and the shelfs consisting of row.
If you search for a book in this system, it display the title of the book, author, section of the library it is, shelf on which it is and the row. Hence, makes it easy for someone to find any book in the library.

This functionality enables library personnel to register borrowers. That is students who borrow book. Also, they can search for a particular borrower by the student Id or can get all borrower's with just a click.
# THE THIRD
This is a statistical functionality that helps library personnel identify, particular faculities or courses that uses the libraries resources the most.
This feature can be found in the Analysis menu.
